# Signal_denoising
A little demonstration of how a Fourier transform can be applied for denoising a signal.

The biggest disadvantage of this approach is the missing time resolution. That is why one rather uses a windowed Fourier transform, commonly known as short-term Fourier transform. Both ideas are illustrated in the following figures.
